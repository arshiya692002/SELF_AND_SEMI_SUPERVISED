# SELF_AND_SEMI_SUPERVISED

Systematic benchmarking of Self-Supervised (DINO, SwAV) and Semi-Supervised (SimMatchV2) methods for medical image classification.

This project is a part of our **major B.Tech project** at the **Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad**, under the supervision of **Dr. Sonali Agarwal**. It presents an empirical comparison of advanced learning strategies for scenarios with limited labeled medical data, using TissueMNIST and PathMNIST datasets.

## Project Objectives

- Evaluate self-supervised vs. semi-supervised learning approaches on medical imaging datasets.
- Improve classification accuracy under limited-label settings.
- Optimize model configurations for practical healthcare scenarios.

## Models Implemented

### Self-Supervised Learning
- **DINO**: Uses a student-teacher architecture with exponential moving average updates.
- **SwAV**: Learns representations by clustering and swapping assignments between augmented views.

### Semi-Supervised Learning
- **SimMatchV2**: Integrates classification, consistency regularization, and similarity-based learning for improved semi-supervised training.

## Datasets Used

- **TissueMNIST**: Histological colorectal cancer tissue images.
- **PathMNIST**: Pathology images from colorectal cancer studies.

> These datasets are not included in the repository due to GitHubâ€™s file size limits.
